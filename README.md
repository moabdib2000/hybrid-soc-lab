Hybrid SOC Lab – Phishing + Incident Response (L1 Focus)

I had an old 2016 Mac Mini, so I thought I'd use it as a lab mouse...

It has a 512GB SSD and 8GB of RAM, so I'll play around with the resources and make things a bit more complicated as the project grows.

** Hybrid SOC Lab – Phishing and Incident Response (L1 Focus) **

## Project overview

This repository documents the step-by-step creation of a small **hybrid SOC laboratory** using open-source tools.

The main goal of this project is to **learn how a Security Operations Center works from an entry-level (SOC L1) perspective**, focusing on detection, alert analysis and incident handling.  
Special attention is given to **phishing-related scenarios**, as they represent one of the most common use cases in real SOC environments.

This is a learning project. It is not intended to simulate advanced attacks or red team activities, but rather to **understand the daily workflow of a SOC analyst**.

---

## What I want to learn with this lab

With this project, I aim to:

- Understand the basic structure and purpose of a SOC
- Learn how security alerts are generated and analyzed
- Practice incident handling and case management
- Get familiar with SIEM, incident response and SOAR concepts
- Improve decision-making around alert triage and escalation
- Work with realistic phishing-related scenarios

---

## General architecture

The lab is built on top of **Proxmox VE**, which is used to host and isolate the different components using virtual machines.

### Why Proxmox

Proxmox is used to:

- Simulate an on-premise corporate environment
- Separate SOC components into different systems
- Easily manage virtual machines and snapshots
- Keep the lab modular and easy to expand

## Main components

- **Proxmox VE**  
  Virtualization platform

- **Windows 10 / 11 endpoint**  
  Simulates a corporate user workstation  
  Wazuh agent installed  
  Used for phishing and suspicious activity scenarios

- **Wazuh**  
  SIEM / XDR platform  
  Centralizes logs and generates security alerts

- **MITRE CALDERA**  
  Used to simulate adversary behavior  
  Focused on detection validation, not exploitation

- **DFIR-IRIS**  
  Incident response and case management platform

- **Shuffle (SOAR)**  
  Used for simple automation and enrichment workflows

- *(Optional – advanced phase)* OpenCTI or MISP  
  Used to add threat intelligence context

---

## Project approach

This lab is designed from the point of view of a **SOC Level 1 analyst**.

Because of that:

- The focus is on analysis and process, not on complex attacks
- Tools are used at a basic and realistic level
- Decisions such as closing or escalating alerts are documented
- Simple playbooks and workflows are preferred

The value of this project is not technical complexity, but **understanding the SOC workflow from start to finish**.

---

## Project phases

The lab is built progressively, phase by phase.

### Phase 0 – Environment preparation
- Proxmox installation and basic configuration
- Network setup
- Creation of base virtual machines

### Phase 0.5 – Endpoint and phishing scenarios
- Deployment of a Windows endpoint
- Wazuh agent installation
- Simulation of phishing-related behavior
- Observation of logs and alerts generated by Wazuh

### Phase 1 – Incident management with DFIR-IRIS
- DFIR-IRIS installation using Docker
- Creation and tracking of security cases
- Basic integration with Wazuh alerts
- Incident lifecycle documentation

### Phase 2 – Automation with Shuffle
- Shuffle installation
- Simple workflows such as:
  - Wazuh alert → enrichment → case creation
- Focus on triage automation, not response actions

### Phase 3 – Threat intelligence context (optional)
- Integration with OpenCTI or MISP
- IOC lookups for alert enrichment
- Supporting decision-making with additional context

---

## Documentation style

Each phase includes:

- What was configured
- What alerts were generated
- How a SOC L1 analyst would analyze them
- When an alert should be closed or escalated
- Example notes or ticket-style documentation

The goal is to **think and work like a SOC analyst**, not like an attacker.

## Project status

Work in progress.  
The lab is being built and documented gradually.
